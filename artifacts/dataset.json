I am requesting a review and modification of the loan terms to better suit my current economic condition.\n\nThe current term of the loan is 30 years, and I am proposing a reduction to a 20-year term, which I believe aligns better with my financial planning. Reducing the term comes with the ambition of securing a new proposed monthly payment that can reflect my improved financial management strategies.\n\nCurrently, my monthly payment stands at $1,500. With the proposed decrease in the loan term, could you provide me with an estimated recalculated monthly payment? Additionally, if applicable under the terms of the refinance, could information on the ARM index and margin affecting my adjustments also be provided? \n\nI appreciate your assistance and am looking forward to a prompt response.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMaxwell Turner",
